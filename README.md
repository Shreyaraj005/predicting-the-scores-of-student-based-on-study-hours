In this task, I've predicted the marks of students based on their study hour using simple linear regression.

The problem statement was to predict the percentage of students if he studies for 9.25 hrs/per day.I have used panda library to read the data, matplotlib, seaborn for data visualisation. I have also used the OLS technique to predict the final result that was 93.69 marks.
